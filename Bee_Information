What is harming the bees

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9947305/
Neonicotinoids and Clothianidin
“there is some evidence that suggests that honeybee genotype may influence tolerance to NNIs.“
“Bee survival after acute clothianidin exposure is heritable, with H2 = 0.38”
“modulated by increased metabolism of NNIs by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP) proteins, although resistance can also be caused by mutations in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors subunits, the target sites of NNIs”
“In honeybees, the CYP3 clade is most closely associated with NNI detoxification.22 After testing all 27 genes in the CYP3 clade, Manjon et al.23 showed the NNIs are metabolized by members of the CYP9Q subfamily, primarily CYP9Q1, CYP9Q2, and CYP9Q3. Natural genetic variation in these genes may thus underlie variation in honeybee tolerance to NNIs.”
“Tolerant patrilines had a single significantly upregulated gene in the Malpighian tubules: fatty acid amide hydrolase 2-B (logFC = 1.12, p < 0.0005).”
“CYP9Q3 appeared to have the largest effect on survival”
“mutation Gln60Glu was predicted to introduce a buried charge and thus potentially change the capacity to bind, recognize, or metabolize clothianidin; however, this residue is not part of any predicted SRS, catalytic site, or pocket. This mutation was found in haplotype A only, which had a high survival rate of 90%.”

Bee background 
“The unfertilized eggs produce drones, whose sole purpose is to fertilize new queens. Adult drones live for about 40 d to 50 d. Fertilized eggs produce females, either worker bees or queens.”
“Eggs are laid and hatch larvae throughout the spring and summer, but brood production stops by late fall, and the bees cease foraging until temperatures warm again in early spring. Honeybees do not hibernate and are active during the winter months, living off of stored honey and clustering to maintain temperatures at acceptable levels.”
“Today, more than 65% of commercial bee colonies in the United States are managed for pollination services 2.”

“Restricted organisms can only be imported for university and/or State/Federal Government research. Importation of restricted organisms requires a PPQ 526 Plant Pest Permit. Details for applying on-line can be found at the e-Permits Website. Restricted organisms require specific consideration when importing or transiting the United States.”

https://beeaware.org.au/archive-pest/tracheal-mite/#ad-image-0
Tracheal mites: “Honey bee colonies are more susceptible to Tracheal mite in cooler climates and during autumn, winter and early spring. This is because of the tendency of honey bee colonies to cluster together in cooler climates, allowing for the easy transfer of Tracheal mite amongst the adult honey bee population.”
“This includes re-queening colonies that are susceptible to the disease, as colonies with young, active laying queens appear to cope with mite infestations much better than colonies with older queens. Tracheal mite resistant honey bee strains (eg Buckfast or Primorsky bees) can also be used. Tracheal mites are believed to have evolved with honey bees (Apis mellifera) and because of this, some strains of bees appear to be highly resistant to the mite. The heritability of this resistance trait is considered to be high and is thought to be primarily expressed as a self-grooming behaviour, termed auto-grooming, thus removing the migrating mites.”
“Another treatment option favoured in many parts of the USA is the use of oil extender patties. These are made from 1 part liquid vegetable oil with 3 parts granulated or powdered sugar.”
“Tracheal mite is not present in Australia but is found in most other honey producing regions of the world, such as Europe, North America and parts of Asia. It is not present in New Zealand.”
“When Tracheal mite infestation is combined with other stresses (eg disease, lack of pollen or nectar etc.) it can lead to the death of the colony. Once a honey bee colony is infested with Tracheal mite it remains infested, with impacts more significant over winter and early spring, contributing to high colony losses in severe cases.”

“The queens were brought to the USDA, ARS, Honey Bee Quarantine Station at Grand Terre Island, Louisiana, on July 1, 1997 and installed into colonies prepared for them. The introduction was monitored by APHIS and the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry. As the colonies developed they were monitored for the presence of disease or parasites. Some colonies in the apiary, headed by queens of four commercial United States stocks, remained in the apiary as an additional check for the presence of slowly developing diseases.”

Bee Climate expectations: “Chen points out this research also offers a promising avenue for new therapeutic strategies to mitigate overwintering and annual colony losses. One way could be by raising the production of the SIRT1 protein by treating honey bees with SRT1720, a specific SIRT1 gene activator being experimentally used as an anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer treatment.”
“SIRT1, a major sirtuin protein that regulates energy and immune metabolism, was significantly downregulated in bees merely exposed to cold challenges. Activation of SIRT1 expression by SRT1720, a SIRT1 activator, could improve the physiology and extend the lifespan of cold-stressed bees.”

Transgenerational Immune Priming
“The research funded and published by this company suggests a modest (30-50%) reduction in the infection of inoculated larvae in a controlled laboratory setting”
“Beekeepers mix the product – in essence, dead cells of the bacterium that causes the disease – into “queen candy,” pretty much cake fondant that beekeepers can feed to colonies since a major part of their diet is sugar. The workers then feed the queen, which in turn primes the eggs she lays to have this transgenerational immune priming.”
“which would further reduce antibiotic-resistant strains and contamination of honey. Second, since antibiotics only prevent the bacteria from sporulating – it doesn’t kill the spores, just prevents them from infecting – the only true way to eradicate the disease is to kill the bees and burn this hive equipment, resulting in tremendous economic losses for the beekeeper.”

“Some of the nation's food industries rely solely on the honey bee, and it's estimated that the economic value of its pollination role is worth well over $17 billion each year.”
“The data showed that the nation's managed honey bee populations rely intensively on a single honey bee evolutionary lineage. In fact, 94 percent of U.S. honey bees belonged to the North Mediterranean C lineage.”
“"It's important that we have a realistic and accurate estimation of the honey bee's genetic diversity because this indicates the insect's ability to respond to disease, adaptation to environment, and productivity," said ARS Research Entomologist Mohamed Alburaki. "Without this pollinator insect, we will witness a drastic decrease in the quantity and quality of our agricultural products such as almonds, apples, melons, cranberries, pumpkins, broccoli and many other fruits and vegetables that we're used to purchasing. We can't wait until a domino effect slowly takes place and affects our food supply."”
“In 2023, colony losses and winter mortality are at a high peak and varroa mite requires multiple treatments per year to keep it under control.”
“Alburaki's research also identified and named 14 novel haplotypes in the three evolutionary lineages. These haplotypes have never been reported before and can provide new insights into the U.S. honey bee's evolution since its importation to North America in the 1600s. There is hope that the researchers can use this information to locate and enhance the numbers of these rare and novel US haplotypes, which could speed the process of reaching a healthier diversity within the nation's honey bee population.”
