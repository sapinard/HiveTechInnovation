A hypothetical company made for class

We are a group of 3 undergraduate and graduate students creating a hypothetical company for our class. Our focus is the health and effectiveness of the Honeybee. 

Honeybees are the top pollinator of flowering plants, including 130 fruits and vegetables that humans consume. In 2023, 48% of all honeybee hives did not survive due to a myriad of reasons like mite infestations, diseases, pesticides, temperature fluctuations, and pests. 

Our company HiveTech Innovations seeks to bolster the honeybee genetics by expanding the honeybee genome and selectively breeding a honeybee that can survive it all. We can identify which honeybee species can survive each problem and combine them to create a hardier bee.

In this survey, you will be asked about your interest in owning your own honeybee hive. Please note that honeybees can thrive in a variety of locations including cities, rooftops, and suburban areas, not just in rural farm locations.

In beekeeping 80% of new beekeepers quit within the first 2 years. We hope to provide support to these aspiring beekeepers and create a long lasting beneficial relationship with our community.
